                            <strong> Local Storage: </strong> <br>

                            It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the client’s computer in the form of
                            key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless
                            the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes
                            the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's
                            memory is cleared.

                            It's data in the browser can only be accessed via JavaScript and HTML5. However, the user
                            also could clear the browser data/cache to erase all local storage data. <br>
                            <strong> Session Storage:</strong> <br>

                            It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference lies in the lifespan as
                            it persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate
                            it, the data on session storage also gets lost.

                            <strong> Global scope:</strong> <br>

                            In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible
                            in, all other scopes.

                            In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the
                            code is being executed. <br>
                            <strong> Block Level Scope:</strong> <br>
                            This scope restricts the variable that is declared
                            inside a specific
                            block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the
                            variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we
                            need to create an object for it. Variables declared with the var keyword, do not have block
                            scope.

                            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing
                            the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is
                            quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br>
                            In event loop there’s a heap, stack and queue. Objects are allocated in a heap which is just
                            a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured) region of memory.
                            Event loop allocates synchronous instruction in call stack, and asynchronous instruction in
                            queue, when the call stack empties, it takes a process from queue, allocates it in call
                            stack and run the process.
